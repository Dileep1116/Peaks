# Peaks

This is Grav theme for my website magmo.co.uk

## Getting Started

You'll need to install a local server enviroment with GRAV

### Prerequisites

Local server enviroment program like MAMP (For Mac) or WARP (For Windows)
GRAV downloaded from https://getgrav.org/downloads (Get the Core + Admin package)

### Installing

Step one - Move the GRAV package into the base of the local server enviroment (The program should tell you where)

Step two - Clone this repo into the grav install /user/themes/

Step three - Start your local server enviroment and you should see a page to create a grav account, do that

Step four - On the left of the page you should see "themes" navigate to that page and select the Peaks theme.

Step five - Thats it! When making a new page be sure to create a page on your local server and then assign the template too it

### Coding Style

Don't worry about formatting correctly, just try to right code minimally and I'll take care of the reset afterwards
